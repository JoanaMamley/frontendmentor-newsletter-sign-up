## Overview

Utilizing Angular, TypeScript, and Bootstrap, I developed a newsletter sign-up form with email validation, seamlessly transitioning to a success state upon accurate input. Error handling mechanisms promptly alert users to incorrect entries, ensuring a smooth and intuitive sign-up experience.

### Features

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
